{"_runtime":0,"model_card":"\n**Model:** Random Forest (final tuned)\n**Objective:** Predict in-hospital mortality for ICU patients\n**Dataset:** PhysioNet 2012 (Set A)\n**Key subgroups:** SOFA score, CSRU vs non-CSRU\n**Calibration:** Verified on Test with reliability tables\n**Thresholds:** Fixed on Validation (sensitivity ≈ 0.85, specificity ≈ 0.90)\n**Intended use:** Decision-support to flag high-risk patients, not for autonomous triage\n**Known limitations:**\n- Derived from retrospective data, not externally validated\n- Potential bias if SOFA or CSRU distribution shifts\n- Performance not guaranteed outside adult ICU cohort\n**Governance:**\n- All experiments tracked in W&B for audit\n- Code and preprocessing pipelines versioned in this notebook\n- Model retraining required if data schema changes\n","_wandb":{"runtime":0}}
