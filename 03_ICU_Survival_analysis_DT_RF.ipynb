It makes no sense to have an alert trigger at a 50% risk if almost no patients have a risk that high, and the actual event rate is much lower. We could estimate a range between 2% to 12% focuseing on this zone of practical decision-making\n",
    "- In an ICU, missing a dying patient (a false negative) is clearly far worse than a false alarm (a false positive). Our low threshold range aims at reflecting this\n",

    "1.  **Select on Validation**: We test all our potential thresholds on the **validation set** and find the single one (`t_star`) that provides the highest net benefit\n",
    "2.  **Report on Test**: We then take this *one*, pre-selected threshold and apply it a single time to the **unseen test set**. The results from this final step are our best, honest, unbiased estimate of how the model would perform in the real world\n",
